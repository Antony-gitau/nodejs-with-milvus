This code implementation is an illustrative example of building a multimodal search using [Milvus node.js SDK client](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-node).

Apart from the index.cjs script, the other scripts are reproduced from this [blog](https://zilliz.com/blog/getting-started-with-the-milvus-javascript-client).

The index.cjs  serves as a highlevel practical guide to getting started with Milvus for multimodal search applications in Node.js, highlighting essential operations such as connection setup, data insertion, and similarity search queries.
